# Natural-Gas-Price-Forecasting

This project uses real-world natural gas price and consumption datasets to build predictive models and detect anomalies across time, state, and sector. By combining data cleaning, visual analytics, machine learning, and risk monitoring, this project empowers stakeholders to make better decisions in energy, construction, and infrastructure management.

## Datasets Used

1. Monthly Natural Gas Prices (1997–2024)  
2. Daily Spot Prices for Natural Gas  
3. State and Sector-based Monthly Gas Consumption (2014–2024)  
   Source: Kaggle (donated by Jason Rymer, BIM Manager)

## Key Insights

- Texas and California are top consumers of natural gas
- Electric Power and Residential sectors show strong seasonal demand
- Price forecasting models perform well on trends, but extreme surges require anomaly detection
- Isolation Forest flagged several major historical price shocks (2001–2009, 2020)
